# Astro: Beyond the basics

This is a project that accompanies Section 3 of the Udemy course _Introduction to the Astro web framework_.

The project introduces some of the more advanced concepts of [Astro](https://astro.build/).

## Branches

The branches are of the format `[lecture-number]-[lecture-title]`, for example, `11-more-on-css`.

Students are encouraged to compare their code with a particular branch to ensure they are on the right track.

The `RECAP.md` file inside each branch contains a summary of important concepts that were introduced in the corresponding lecture.
